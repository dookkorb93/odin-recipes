        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Carbonara is a classic Italian dish with simple, and few, ingredients, but can be just as simple to mess up.
            With only eggs, cheese, pasta, and pork, you would think that making it is as easy as the gathering of the
            ingredients. And for some, it can be. Whether that's using egg yolks and whole eggs as opposed to all whole eggs, or 
            being a stickler on "bacon doesn't belong in carbonara" and only using pancetta or guanciale. And I think we can all 
            agree to never add cream!
        </p>

        <p>
            The fundamentals of making a carbonara great come down to the sauce, ensuring it cooks just enough to form a thick, silky
        coating on the pasta and not accidentally scrambling the eggs. For this recipe, we will be using pancetta for our pork, but 
        I have used bacon before (don't tell Italians). In addition, for the cheese will be a Pecorino Romano, an aged sheeps-milk cheese;
        and we will be utilizing many more egg yolks over whole eggs.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 pound of spaghetti pasta, uncooked</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pancetta, bacon, or if you have, guanciale</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 whole eggs plus 6 yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, plus more for serving</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring, until al dente.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine pancetta with olive oil in a large skillet and cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat,
                    until fat has rendered and the pancetta is crisp, about 7 minutes. Turn off heat.</li>
                <li>In a large, heatproof mixing bowl, whisk together whole eggs and yolks, Pecorino Romano, and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Using tongs and/or strainer, transfer pasta to the skillet with the pancetta and its fat; do not drain pasta water.
                    Add remaining oil to pasta and stir to combine, letting it cool slightly. Scrape pasta, pancetta, and all the fat 
                    into the egg mixture. Measure 1/2 cup pasta-cooking water and add to pasta and egg mixture. Stir well to combine.</li>
                <li>Keep stirring quickly with tongs while pasta is still warm, being sure to avoid letting it rest or get too hot, therefore 
                    preventing the eggs from cooking and scrambling. Stir until saues thickens to a creamy and silky consistency and leaves
                    trails as you stir.</li>
                <li>Season with salt, if needed and divide into bowls. Serve right away, topping with more cheese or pepper as desired.</li>
            </ol>

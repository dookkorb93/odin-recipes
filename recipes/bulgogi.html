    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Bulgogi is a Korean dish made of thinly sliced marinated meat, traditionally using soy sauce,
        sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, pear and gochujang. It is most commonly used with beef,
        but can also be made with chicken or pork. My go-to beef to use is a <strong>ribeye</strong>, 
        due to its fattiness and tenderness, best tasting after throwing it on the cast iron.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some tips to get started beforehand are to:
        <ul>
            <li>Freeze the steak for between 20-30 minutes for easier slicing</li>
            <li>Using an Asian pear for its tenderizing properties</li>
            <li>Using a super hot cast iron grill pan</li>
            <li>Cook in batches</li>
            <li>Freeze leftovers as needed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li><strong>1-1/2 pounds</strong> boneless ribeye steak</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> Asian pear <em>coarsley grated</em></li>
            <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> soy sauce</li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> brown sugar</li>
            <li><strong>5 cloves</strong> garlic <em>minced</em></li>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> gochujang, <em>Korean red pepper paste</em></li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> vegetable oil <em>divided</em></li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> green onions <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steak in freezer for 20-30 minutes, then take out and thin slicly, cutting
                into approximately 1/4-inch thick slices. A good rule of thumb is to cut at around
                a 45 degree angle.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine grated pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, grated
                ginger, and gochujang. Combine sauce mixture with the thinly sliced steak into a container
                or Ziploc bag and let it marinate from anywhere between 2 and 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Heat up a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.
                Working in batches, add steak to the pan in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until charred
                and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. Repeat with oil and steak as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately. Garnish with green onions and/or sesasme seeds, if preferred.</li>
        </ol>
